            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Knight, principall Secretarie to the Queenes moſte excellent Maieſtie, and
of her Maieſties moste honorable priuie Councell, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T ſuch time (right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable) as I at the requeſt of
certaine my deere and welbeloued freendes, had beene at her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Towre
of London: partlie to haue ſome talke with the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and other
Seminaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly there impriſoned: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to ſee if the Lorde
would haue quickened them after great preaching and much conference, with manie
and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie learned men that came thether: I did finde, that the trauaile and
ſtudy of theirs, hath to this day taken ſo ſmall effect, as not onely the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> are more and more ſtiffned in their errors: But alſo,
they are become ſo ſenceleſſe in feeling, ſo blunt in attayning, ſo
wicked and malicious in reſiſting, ſo diſloy all and ſpitefull in
hearing, ſo ſturdie and malaperte in withſtanding openlie the teachers of
the Goſpell; as the people are vpon the ſame diſmayed, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and godly
men diſcouraged, and all fortes of people moſte pittifully diſtracted,
that either heere or ſee them at any time.</p>
            <p>VVherefore may it pleaſe you to vnderſtand, that for diuers
cauſes, I haue giuen vnto your Honour this briefe<pb facs="tcp:5741:3"/>and ſhorte
Confutation of their Hereſies. Firſt, that their damnable and groſſe
errors though they may be ſeene of all, may yet (eſpecially) be knowne vnto
you: For I doo thinke, that the reformation and order to bee taken for theſe
Heretiques, dooth lye (in eſpeciall) on your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and is required at
Gods handes of the Lordes of her Maieſties moſte Honourable priuie
Councell: Secondly, that it may appeere, whenſoeuer theſe wicked men
ſhalbe called to an accompte, that then they will not be able to denie or
diſſemble that which they affirme: For the moſte principall, though not
all their Articles, are confuted in this booke. Thirdely, I am of opinion, that
eſperiallye your Honour hath to diſcerne the ſpirits of theſe men, in
as much as you be in the number of thoſe, that in <hi>Roome,</hi> (togeather
with many other of the nobles in this Realme) were threatened to be burned by
the Pope, if he gat you either quicke or dead: The laſte and the cheefe
cauſe is this.</p>
            <p>As your Honour hath beene alwayes a fauourer of the Goſpell, and
moſte forwarde in Religion, ſo I truſt that God will now mooue you, to
haue a more care of his poore Church then euer you had. It is not vnknowne how
God hath looued this Realme, ſithence her Maieſties moſte gratious and
happie raigne among vs. The like reſt with ſuch quietnes, the like peace
with ſuch bleſſednes, the like comfort with ſuch happines, was neuer
ſeene vnder any Nation and people, as we haue had vnder her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. Now
at lengthe, after ſo longe and proſperous and peaceable gouernment, to put
this Realme in feare and dread of that woonted Tirranie, which Antichriſte
the Pope practiſed vpon vs. To ſtirre and mooue vp by way of alienation the
mindes of men, and the faithfull hartes of Englande: to make vs remember the
blood that was<pb facs="tcp:5741:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhed of olde time by the Pope, to compell vs
againe to ſorrow ouer the bodies of our dead, and ouer the Sainctes whoſe
blood was ſhed, and ouer the multitude of good men, that were taken from vs:
There are in the ſteede and roome of thoſe blodie Fathers, riſen and now
in proceſſe of time growne vp, their bloodie and vnnaturall ſonnes. Among
theſe, ſome would haue hathed their hands in the harts of our people, as
<hi>Saunders</hi> in Ireland of late was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do, (and it is not to
be thought that he was there alone.)</p>
            <p>Some write againſt vs, as though wee were Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticques, and
accompt vs worthy to be put to death: (what would theſe men doo, if they had
vs in their handes?) Of which ſort is, <hi>Iohn Howlet,</hi> and one,
<hi>Campion:</hi> who bothe of them haue preſented their mindes moſte
praeſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the right Honourable the Lordes of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
priuie Councell: ſome alſo haue ſpread abroade their damnable and
ſeditious Doctrine, thorowe out manie places in this Realme. Such bee the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> and other Schollers of the Pope,
that bee now in her Maieſties Towre of London: Now, all theſe are come
hether, and ſente in of late dayes by the Pope, to diſturbe vs, and rayſe
Tumults in this Common wealth. And all theſe are the children of ſuch
Fathers, as perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Saints: or they be home borne children, &amp;
brought vp in England, being the wicked ſonnes of wicked Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and they
all haue beene maintained by that man of ſinne, Antichriſte. For all which
thinges, it cannot be gainſay de, but that theſe practiſing Heretiques,
are moſt woorthy to haue the lawe of God in execution againſt them, which
he hath ſet downe for them in his Booke. I doo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what our
Fathers, and Forefathers did: <hi>Dauid</hi> at the hower of his death, called
to minde the iniquitie of a<pb facs="tcp:5741:4"/>man of his, that ſhed blood: and when
he lay on his death bed, he ſayd thus to his ſonne <hi>Salomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>Thou knoweſt what Ioab the ſonne of
Seruiah did to me, and what he did to the two Captaines of the hoast of
Iſrael, vnto Abner the ſonne of Ner, and vnto Amaſa the ſonne of
Iether, whome he ſtone &amp; shed blood of battaile in peace; Doo therefore
according to thy Wiſedome, and let not his hearie haires goe downe to the
graue in rest.</hi> The ſame alſo ſayde <hi>Dauid,</hi> of the ſonne of
<hi>Gera,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iemini</hi> of <hi>Bahurim,</hi> neither did
he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt him innocent. It is well knowne, what woorthy and warlike fellowes
the Papiſts ſlewe, and how they were cunning men at the Battailes of the
Lord, and as ready to reſiſt and fight againſt Sathan in ſpirituall
skirmiſhes, as <hi>Abner</hi> or <hi>Amaſa</hi> either euer were, in
defending their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their maiſter <hi>Dauid:</hi> It is
neceſſarie therfore, thoſe good men ſhould be remembred, in as much as
they were ſlaine ſo trayterouſlie: And now the rather, are we all to
thinke vpon that treaſon of olde, as there are riſen vp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall and
wicked men to trouble vs: Irreuerend &amp; diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient perſons, to prouoke
vs: faithleſſe, and hollowe hearted Papiſts, to diſquiet vs: fooliſh
and erronious <hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> to inueagle &amp; withdraw vs from the
Lord. Theſe are they haue practiſed ſo many things againſt vs, this
many yeeres: theſe are the wicked, whome the godlie haue fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; theſe are
the diſturbers, haue diſquieted this Realme; theſe are the conſpirators
haue withholden the hearts of the wicked, from their loyaltie; theſe are
they, that if God had not beene on our ſide, would long ere this haue
ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne vs. VVe know that Papiſtes, were authors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the
North. We know, that as in the Shambles men ſell meate, ſo in their priuate
aſſemblies, haue theſe wicked ones, bothe bought and ſolde vs of

witchcraft, ſorcerie, &amp; inchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment, to deſtroy the Lordes annointed.
It is ſeene, how vnquiet her Maieſties Realme of Ireland hath been, and all
only thorow them. It is ſeen, what ſignes and Croſſes, the Papiſtes
haue had brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as is their <hi>Agnus Deis,</hi> and other Tablets,
which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually they weare about their necks, as toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be known by, if
time ſerued. And it is ſeene and perceiued of all open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, how that
innumerable Bulles, and Pardons, haue &amp; are continuallie ſent ouer by the
Pope. And can or may, true and faithfull Chriſtians ſee all this, and not
ſpeake? Naie, the heauens &amp; the earth, crie out againſt them; and if

Lords quarrell, and the feare of his name that hath doone it. And in the ſame
I haue great reaſon moouing me therevnto, which your Honour ſhall
vnderſtande, and they all perceiue, that ſhall reade this Booke. But it
hath greeued me moſte of all, and ſtirred me vp eſpetially, in that I
haue from time to time, ſeene and vewed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent<pb facs="tcp:5741:6"/>behauiour,
and bolde preſumptions of the Papiſts: Amonge whom, ſome men of late
time, in a ſound ſpeech, perfect tongue, fine wit, and choyſe phraſe
(as they did thinke of them ſelues) haue raſhly encroached vpon her
Maieſtie, and vpon your Honours, the Lords of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Honourable
priuie Councell, with ſundrie of theyr bookes: Thereby making vs beleeue,
that becauſe they durſte doo it, they did it well. Of theſe Maiſter
<hi>Harding</hi> was the firſt, that reuolted and ranne away from Chriſte,
but neuer returned, who by this time knoweth, whether he did well or euill. And
<hi>Oſorius,</hi> did but the other day ſende abroade his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nfections, to
poyſon the young Frie of England: who, as he flaunteth it out in a leafe or

out euery where vnpleaſauntly, and then healeth vp the wound ſo rawly
againe, as that his gleaned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp corne, ſtolne words, borrowed ware,
deceiptfull ſtile, quauering Notes, and ſlaunderous ſpeeches againſt

Moreouer the other day was the like ſeene, for the Snowe hath not yet falne

For whye? the Lorde is on our ſide, and he rayſeth vp bothe the eloquent

they are bewitched with falſehood and lyes? The Lorde our God is he that we

woorde, the Lorde ſhalbe reuenged on them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For my owne parte,
what I haue ſet downe againſt our aduerſaries the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in

I haue ſpoken to the indifferent Reader, and he, all that I haue doone vnto

That her Maieſtie may raigne long time ouer vs, to ſee the iudgements of
our God put in execution, that her Grace may ſee an end of all vnquietnes,
diſſention, and ſtrife, and eſtabliſh peace, vnitie, and concorde in

I ſay, that of all Nations and Countries vnder heauen, we haue hitherto liued

be able to ſtande, as hetherto we haue done, which he onely knoweth, not man.
Of this I am certaine, and for the ſame I haue a good warrant: that if our

of your ſect, and your hereſies, (with whome I doo confeſſe, I haue

ſuppoſing it was a newe Doctrine: Your Maſſemongers and Idoll

heads, with ſo great and déepe Myſteries. And diuers of your Church

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I ſée plainlie, that you doo but caſt away the ſoules

how cunningly ſoeuer you gloſe, and do ceitfully ſoeuer it be, that you
colour your imquitie, the Lord ſhall reueale it, and we doo knowe it
alreadie: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will firſt of all begin with this pointe of our
faithe, this ended I will come to the reſt: In all which I promiſe that no

you a good and ſufficient warrant out of the booke of God:</p>

gather, and collect a proper ſimilitude to expreſſe this: for there is
the body, and we ſtand by it: there is the ſoule, we are quickened and liue

you will replie and ſay, Why? diuers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of our opinion: why?
many of the Doctors, ſay as we ſay: why? the Schoole men, the greateſt

amiſſe, the Lord our God, neuer troade his foote awrie: the Schoolemen,

all the worlde on your ſide, you are deceyued: for albeit one or two of the
Fathers, or more haue allowed in part, the prayers to the dead, and to Saints:
yet for all that, I can and will, appoſe others againſt them of more
ſounder indgement a great deale, that doo thinke it vtterlie vnlawfull,<note place="margin">Errors of the Fathers.</note> to pray vnto the Saintes. And what
though <hi>Anathaſius</hi> dyd thinke, that it was lawfull to pray to the
Virgin <hi>Marie?</hi> ſhall we therefore ſubſcribe? I tell you no: for I
will neither holde with <hi>Baſill,</hi> nor with <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

               </hi> And to the ſame, vpon the fiftie and

               </hi> That is, <hi>The eares of the

he is contrarie to the other places of praying to Saintes: for firſt,

<hi>Baſill</hi> in his booke, <hi>De vita ſolitaria,</hi> is verie flat
againſt him ſelfe: &amp; he ſpeaketh much in other places againſt
praying<pb facs="tcp:5741:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>to Saints: For this he ſaith, <hi>Ora ad Deum cum

excludeth all other: For it went a lyttle afore, <hi>Pete ex fide ſemper quod

good.</hi>
               </hi> Faith excludeth héere, praying to Saintes,
ſéeing that Faith and beléefe, is not to be repoſed in them:
I may ſay the ſame of <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> and of
<hi>Ambroſe:</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> him ſelfe, is flat againſt

the ſame in his booke of True Religion, and they will ſatiſfie you, in
this Queſtion of praying, and to whome to pray. Wherefore, I will conclude
with two reaſons, drawne out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">Pſal.
51.6. Iob. 14.4. Pron 24.16. Rom. 3.10.</note> The firſt is this: They which
ſinne as wée doo, can not be helpers of vs, in our prayer: for all
prayer is to them that are holie and perfect: but the Saintes haue ſinned,
and<pb facs="tcp:5741:38"/>ſinne as we doo: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm.
3.8. Eſa. 27.3. Hoſ. 13.4.</note> we haue no cauſe to pray to them, but
to the Lord that can helpe vs. Alſo it is euident that prayer is not to be
giuen to any, but ſuch as can helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and other: Now the Saints
can helpe neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor any other, but Chriſte Ieſus onely
muſt doo it. Then no prayer is to be giuen to them: for this is the nature of
prayer and ſuch things are to be required herein.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1. Firſt, we muſt pray to God, for he heareth the
prayers of the whole world.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2. Secondly, to one that is able, and can doo all
thinges, which onely is God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3. Thirdly, that he be a worthy Perſon to whom we pray,
and ſo is none but the Lord.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>4. Fourthly, that he be no creature, leaſt we derogate
from the creator: ſo that the dead haue no portion or inheritaunce in our
prayers, but onely the Lord.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Now therefore, I will conclude, that <hi>Iſraell</hi> muſt all
one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue the Lorde his God, and none other: neither in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, neither
in earth, neither aboue the heauens, neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the earth, is there
any one to whom we muſt giue homage, but onelye to him. Then, take the Cuppe
of ſalna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into your handes, and call on the name of the Lorde. Sanctifie
your ſelues, and drawe néere to his Tabernacle: A ſtronge Towre is
the name of the Lord, he that runneth to him ſhalbe ſaued: In
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is ſaluation, and on the heads of the Goodly is
ſtrengthe: no falſehood is found in the wiſe, and no halting in thoſe
that feare God. Though the world doo delight in Chariots, and the Kinges of the
earth in their Horſes, and great men in theyr ſtrength, yet will we onely
call vpon the name of the Lord: we wil ſay, glory to the higheſt, and
prayſes vnto him in the vppermoſt heauens: we<pb facs="tcp:5741:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>will offer
ſacrifice of thankes giuing vnto our God, and paye our vowes to the
Almightie: we will ſinge to the Lord a new ſonge, and <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall
not ſtaye to prayſe her God: we will ſinge with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
prayſe the Lorde with <hi>Aaron</hi> in his holy aſſemblye: we will not
giue his powre vnto man, nor the ſtrength of his arme vnto a Forrainer: our
Crownes ſhalbe ſet vpon his heade, and we will fall downe to him as to our
God: we will giue bleſſing, and glorie, and honour vnto him that ſitteth
on the Throne for euer and euer, and all the Beaſts of the earth ſhall
ſubſcribe vnto vs. But as for you, you haue not knowne the Lord, the God of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> hath not béene your defence: you haue giuen his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the great Beaſt, and the Oragon hath frayed you, ſo that you haue his
markes of blaſphemie in your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: you haue ſerued that great whore,
and bowed your knées to the Woman of ſinne: Therefore ſhall your
portion be without the Gates of the holy Cittie, and you ſhall not
ſée the Lambs, and his face for euer: In the Vinepreſſe of his
wrathe ſhall you bee troden to péeces, and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, your
portion ſhalbe Fier and Brimſtone for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>You are the ſonnes of the bloody Fathers that haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the

You are the <hi>Chemerims</hi> that haue offered vp of the Children of God vnto

Calues, euen the golden Calues of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell.</hi> You haue

vp: Wherefore wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this blood at your handes, if you will not
returne and come vnto the Lorde:<pb facs="tcp:5741:39"/>Truely, your blood ſhalbe
ſpilt at the Poole of <hi>Samaria</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worde of the Lorde:
and that <hi>Roome</hi> ſhalbe as the houſe of <hi>Baaſa.</hi> The Sworde
of the Lord ſhall waxe red with blood, and he ſhall reioyce in the fat of
the ſlaine: As did the Children of <hi>Edome</hi> at the day of his wrath,
ſo ſhall you ſée the bones of your mighty men, lye in the
ſtréetes: For the Lorde hath ſeene you and he hath tryed you; you
are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wayed in the Ballaunce, and you are founde to light. And if now
you repent not, and retorne not: If now you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not, and reuolte not from
your errors, as I found you, ſo I muſt leaue you open to the hand of the
enimie. And it ſhalbe my prayer bothe day and night, that the Lord would
quicken you, or that he would ſhorten you: that the Lorde would amend you, or
that he would ende you, that you be not reſerued as flaming firebrands, till
the day of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to conſume any more of the Saincts of God. And
for the ſecond parte of this my Sermon, the next time that I come hether, and
when I haue leiſure, you ſhall know and vnderſtande more.

            <p>Nowe then, you haue the originall of your goodly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: no
doubt of many yeares, long time, great antiquitie which you ſo holde of,
being a thing found out almoſt but the other day. Yet if it were ſo (as in
the ſame you be ſhameleſſe<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5741:52"/>lyars) that all your
ordinaunces and decrées were of many thouſand yeres, what matter were
that to proue the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or vnlawfulneſſe of the ſame? For
ſéeing that you haue no allowance of them, nor any one thing among
you, that may be tolerated by the Scriptures, thoſe opinions receiued
commonly by you, can be no other then damnable: and ſo I will conclude for
this point of your Maſſe, and for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and entrance in of the
ſame into the Church.</p>
            <p>We haue thirdly to enquire, whether your Maſſe be a
propitiatorie ſacrifice or not, for the quicke and the dead? I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> and I wil proue it is not. In the ſcriptures I
finde not, that the ſupper of the Lorde is called a <hi>ſacrifice:</hi> but
other names it hath: It is called the <hi>newe Teſtament:</hi> The
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles call it the <hi>breaking of breade:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes
2.</note> Paul calleth it the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.
Cor. 10.</note> and a communication <hi>of the bodie and bloud of
Chriſt:</hi> and the <hi>Cup of the Lorde.</hi> But as for the name of
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it was neuer vſed, it was neuer mentioned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But you ſay the Fathers called it ſo. Why? what then? ſhall we beare
their ſinnes? or ſhall we anſwere their iniquities? or defend all that
they ſpake? you are deceiued: <hi>to the Lawe and to the Prophets,<note place="margin">Eſa.
8.</note> if they ſpeake not according to the word of God,<note place="margin">As the Prophets had all thinges by word from God: ſo muſt we
allowe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that came not from Chriſt.</note> there
is no trueth in them.</hi> Nowe alſo you belye the Fathers, they called the
ſupper of the Lorde a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice indéede; but they called not your
Maſſe a propitiatorie ſacrifice for the quicke &amp; for the dead: this
ought you to proue and leaue the other. Therefore I will come plainely and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to you, aunſwering you firſt that you haue no one place in the
Scriptures or Fathers to proue this propoſition: <hi>Maſſe is a
ſacrifice for the quicke and for the dead:</hi> Secondly, I will proue by the
Scripture, that there is no ſuch thing:</p>
            <p>My firſt reaſon is this: We are iuſtified before God all
only by faith, therfore not by the worke and déed at the Maſſe done
by any. The argument holdeth it ſelfe vp, vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the word of
God:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.2. Diuers reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt the
maſſe.</note> For a Scripture ſaith, <hi>Si ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus iustificatus
pater Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> If Abraham had bene iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by workes, then
had Abraham wherein to reioyce: but Abraham had not wherein to reioyce:
Therefore Abraham was not iuſtified by workes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:5741:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ioel ſaith: <hi>Iuſtus ex fide

his faith.</hi>
               </hi> But, <hi>he that is iuſtified and liueth by faith, is
not inſtified by the worke he worketh, and ſacrifice he ſacrificeth in
the Maſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is none iuſtified and ſaued by the
worke in the Maſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Iohn it is thus written:<note place="margin">Iohn

Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the ſacrifice in the Maſſe, a man can not
haue eternall life:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in Iohn I finde a reaſon ſhewed, of the comming of

            <p>Nowe in the Maſſe, neither is Chriſte knowne, nor our faith
ſéene, nor the loue of God euident, nor yet life giuen vs: but all is
thought to be accompliſhed by a worke of man in ſacrifice: therefore your
Maſſe can not be a propitiation for vs. There is a moſt excellent place
in the ſame Euangeliſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.29.</note> as followeth: A
queſtion was moued by the people, what worke they ſhould worke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

accompliſh the workes of God: It is aunſwered by Chriſte thus: <hi>This
is the worke of God,<note place="margin">Chriſte was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp for man: Frgo,
a Prieſt at the Maſſe may not offer vp for man: for then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he
Chriſtes office in hand.</note> that you beleeue in him whome he hath
ſent.</hi> Nowe I inferre this: God ſent his Chriſt to dy for vs, not a
man, not a Prieſt, not a Monke, to offer at Maſſe a ſacrifice for vs:
therefore the worke in the ſacrifice of your Maſſe, is not the worke of
God: But what fooliſhneſſe is it for you to ſay, that you can make a
propitiatorie ſacrifice for vs? why, you are confuted againe by ſcripture.
For Paul ſaith to the Romanes:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That
there was one only ſacrifice of Chriſt offered once for al:</hi> then I
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that was done once, and was ſufficient, may not be done any more,
for that is vaine: Chriſte was once offered, and it was<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5741:53"/>ſufficient,<note place="margin">Chriſt left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie

na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and in ſo neceſſary a thing Chriſt wold not haue forgotten
vs.</note> and it was good, and it was auaylable, and there néed no
more: <hi>Ergo,</hi> your ſacrifices at your Maſſe, for the quick and for
the dead are in vaine: And nowe I demaund againe, why you ſhould yet ſtand
in your follie? Is it bicauſe you are ignoraunt? learne: Is it bicauſe you
are lead away? turne backe then, and amend: Is it bicauſe the light is kept
from you? pray, and you ſhall attaine the light: Is it bicauſe the
Scriptures are hard? reſiſt not the ſpirite, and you ſhall haue
vnderſtanding: For caſt vp your eyes, beholde, and looke on the booke of
God. Read to the Hebrues the ſeuenth chapter: It will appeare euidently, that
Chriſt onely being high Prieſt, dyed once for all, and being offered vp,
there nowe néedeth no more ſacrifice to the end of the world:<note place="margin">The order of the prieſthoode of Melchiſedech was an order by

                  </gap> nowe, none was euer like Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech
but Chriſt: and none for euer like Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after again: then
there is no prieſt hood behind to be looked for.</note> For in the
compariſon of Chriſte with Melchiſedech, (which is the more honourable
Prieſthood) the Leuitical being abrogated, Melchiſedech ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be
conſidered, and is figured in ſimilitude like Chriſt, for theſe
cauſes: <hi>Melchiſedech was King &amp; Prieſt, as is Chriſt, elſe
none: Melchiſedech was king of peace and righteouſneſſe, as is
Chriſt, but none other: Melchiſedech is ſaid to be without beginning, and
without ending: for neither his father nor his mother, nor his aunceſtors,
nor his death are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of: and ſuch a one is the ſonne of God, to wit,
an euerlaſting Prieſt. As he is God, moſt wonderfully without a mother be
gotten before all worldes: And as he is man without father, wonderfully
concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the holy ghoſt:</hi> Now as the compariſon ſtandeth thus,
ſo alſo is there no compariſon at all of Chriſt, with the
ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Prieſtes of Leuie, but with the Prieſthoode of
Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech: wherevpon I conclude thus:
<q>Melchiſedech was a figure of ſuch a prieſthood in
Chriſt, as is not terreſtriall, but heauenly: but Chriſt offered daily in
your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is not heauenly, but terreſtriall:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſte is not, and can not be daily offered vp for vs in your
Maſſe, being heauenly and with his father:</q> It followeth in the ſame
place,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> that the prieſthood of Chriſt is
ſuch a one as may not paſſe from one to an other: Now yours paſſeth
from prieſt to prieſt euery day, wherfore yours is not like vnto
Chriſtes. Moreouer, he that is a high Prieſt for vs, muſt haue theſe
properties in him: Firſt, ſuch a one as of him<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5741:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelf is able to ſaue: Secondly, ſuch a one,<note place="margin">The
things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited of the high prieſt, are not found in yours: Ergo, yours are
no prieſtes.</note> as by whom we may come to God: Thirdly, one that euer
liueth, and one that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for vs. Then, he muſt be holy;
then, he muſt be harmleſſe; then, he muſt be vndefiled: then, he muſt
be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from ſinners; laſt of al, made higher than the heauens, and
that néedeth not daily to haue a ſacrifice offered vp: Now that I may
conclude and ſhut vp this piece alſo: I ſay, that all theſe thinges are
neither found in your Prieſtes nor in your ſacrificers: therefore all your
ſacrifices at your Maſſe, and elſe where, are not lawfull.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be enquired of in your Maſſe, is this:
That if it be no ſacrifice, yet whether or no it be a worke ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to
iuſtifie, or that a man may be ſaued by the ſame, yea or no? I anſwere,
that your Maſſe is no worke of iuſtification: that is able to iuſtifie,
for ſo you vnderſtand it: I proue it thus, and you, if you will learne,
ſhall knowe it thus: namely,<note place="margin">Actes 4.12. Actes 15.11. Ephe.
2.5. Heb. 7.25. Ioel 2.32.</note>
               <q>We haue not two wayes, or two meanes vnto ſaluation, but one
only way and meane vnto ſaluation: Nowe Chriſt is the way, the dore and the
life, and by him only haue we a meane and paſſage to his father: therfore,
by the worke of the Maſſe (excluded and without Chriſt) you can not haue
any way or entrance vnto ſaluation.</q> This we knowe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> if your Maſſe
were ſufficient to ſaluation, then it was firſt a vaine thing for God the
father to haue ſent his ſonne,<note place="margin">Groſſe errours

might haue found out a ſacrifice of Maſſe here in the earth, ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for vs: Secondly, what cauſe was there, Chriſt ſhould dye for our
ſinnes, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> you haue found out another ordinary way vnto
life? Thirdly, wherfore ſhould Chriſt be made a ſacrifice for vs, if you
your ſelues can make a ſacrifice ſufficient? For which cauſes, you
teach, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one may ſée, very damnable doctrine, &amp; there is

carnally: you haue it not fleſhly: you haue it not verily fleſh, blood, and
bone, in the ſacrament. The ſame maner of ſpeach alſo in the
ſcripture concerning Chriſt, is found euery where: Chriſt was the rocke
that guſhed out water:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.1.</note> yet Chriſt
was not in the rocke: and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> are of the
ſame opinion, that the rocke ſignified Chriſt. Chriſt was in the ſame
manner compared to the rodd of Aaron that bloſſomed: to the golden pott,
wherein the Manna was: to the Manna that came downe from heauen:<note place="margin">Ieſuites are in a damnable &amp; moſt dangerous eſtate,
reſiſting this ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted veritie</note> to the brazen ſerpent
that was lifted vp in the wilderneſſe: to the Prophet Ionas that was

ſheepeheard, which is a keeper of ſhéepe: To a Lyon of the Tribe of
Iuda, which deuowred: to a Lambe which is commonly ſlayne for men: yet was
not Chriſt really in all theſe; no more is he corporally in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread at
the table. Now, if all only this kind of ſpeech were vſed of Chriſt, you
might ſay ſomething: but I tell you that not only of Chriſt and his
perſon all alone is this vſed, but of all manner of things too in the booke
of God. Chriſte ſayde of Iudas, I haue choſen twelue, and one of you is a

followeth: <hi>Coena dominica est ſacramentum Pietatis, ſignum est
Vnitatis,<note place="margin">The Fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vſed to ſay, really, bodily,

appeareth, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thought as we doe thinke, and beléeued
as we doe betéeue: which was, that we haue a ſpiritual foode, and a
ſpiritual drinke, in theſe external elements and outward ſignes of breade
and wine. Moreouer, the Scripture is euident and plaine, and proueth this which
I haue ſpoken, that is, howe Chriſte is bodily and naturally in the
heauens, not bodily in the earth.<note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> In Marke
it is thus written: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that is,
Chriſt was taken vp into heauen: <hi>But he that is there, is not alſo
bodily here with vs: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt is not bodily here on earth.</hi>
In Luke I find this:<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, he went from them:
<hi>But in bodie Chriſte went from them, and in the ſame bodie Chriſte is
with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not bodilie and carnally with men vpon the
earth.</hi> Another argument: <hi>Semper pauper es habebitis vobiſcum,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.11.</note> non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem me:</hi> that is, <hi>The poore ye
ſhall alwayes haue with you,<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5741:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>but me you can not

<hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt is not with them, nor where they be here vpon the
earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, ſéeing Chriſt is not corporally with vs, nor in
fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bodily preſence: We haue to inquire and ſearch out the
manner of his being here on earth. For it is true, that we eate and drinke his
bodye and his bloud,<note place="margin">They that will learne, they muſt apply
one ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> but after another manner then you
affirme. None is ignorant, howe that man conſiſteth of bodye and of
ſoule: Therefore it is expedient we ſhould as well be fed with ſpirituall
foode, as it is neceſſaris we ſhould liue by temporall meate: of which
thing, if any man here be ignoraunt, then is it bicauſe the ſpirite of GOD
hath not quickened him: For if you reade the ſixt of Iohn, you ſhall finde
it moſt apparantly. Alſo Chriſte ſaith in an other place,
<hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt after
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for they ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> Therefore as there
is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, which is an internall famiſhment, ſo is there a

Tertullian</hi>
               </hi> hath an excellent ſaying: <hi>Sermonem constituens
viuificatorem, quia ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus &amp; vita ſermo, eundem etiam carnem ſuam
dixit, quia &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo caro erat factus: Proinde in cauſam vitae
appetendus, &amp; deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus auditu, &amp; ruminandus intellectu, &amp; fide
digerendus:</hi> That is, <hi>Chriſt appointing the word of life, called the
ſame worde his fleſh, both bicauſe that the worde is ſpirite and life,
and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the worde was made fleſh: Therefore, as the onely way to
life Chriſt is to be deſired, and by hearing is he to be conſumed, and by
the vnderſtanding is he to be chawed, and by faith is he to be
diſgeſted:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athanaſ. de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato in Spir.
San.</note> I doe call to minde what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> ſaith:
<hi>Dominus aijt, quae dixi vobis, ſpiritus ſunt &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp;c.</hi>
That is, <hi>The Lorde ſaith, the things which I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto you, are
ſpirite and life:</hi> which is as much (ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius) as that
which eye hath ſeene, and that which is giuen for vs, ſhall be giuen as the
foode and meate of men.</hi> Wherefore, ſéeing it is euident, that
Chriſte is the breade of<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5741:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>life; ſomething muſt
be ſpoken of the ſame, and it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of all Chriſtians,
what is to be helde for trueth. I will for this cauſe, briefly diſcuſſe
this queſtion in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe principall pointes: Firſt, what
is meant by breade in the Scriptures: Secondly, howe Chriſte is ſaide to be
the breade of life: Thirdly, wherefore he, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be this
breade: Fourthly, howe this breade is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by vs.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, which concerneth breade, I ſay thus much: I am
not ignorant that it is diuerfly taken in the Scriptures: yet is all that which
may be ſpoken hereof, not ſo appertinent to the matter, as is worthie of
very long diſcourſe. Breade is taken for loaues of breade ſometimes: as
in Matthew 15. and in Luk. 11. <hi>Where the neighbour doth borowe three
loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the neighbour:</hi> alſo the <hi>Manna is called bread,</hi> in
Iohn the 6. and by a figure, by <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> doth breade ſignifie all
kinde of meate what ſo euer: and ſo ſaide God vnto Adam:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>In fudoré valius tui &amp;c.</hi> That
is, <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes ſhalt thou eate thy breade:</hi> So

may be ſaide of infinite places in the Scripture. Nowe here vpon it commeth
by a Metaphor, that the worde of God is called breade: For as the one
féedeth corporally, ſo the other nouriſheth ſpiritually to
eternall life: and thus doe I thinke that the breade is called the body of
Chriſte, by the ſame analogie.</p>

I am not to diſcourſe of at this preſent copiouſly, but to wade in them
as ſpéedily, as I may: I will giue you a verie fewe, and in

               <hi>In that Chriſt doth and perfourmeth
